# The Environment of Deep-Reinforcement-Learning
An implementation of the environment of DRL in specific field.

## The Trajectory Environment
A **trajectory environment** for **Mobile Crowdsensing Problem** solved by **DRL**. Including management of participants and tasks, feature extraction of trajectory factors, system state simulation and reward computing, etc.

###1. Mobile Crowdsensing Problem and DRL

With a massive deployment of mobile devices, crowdsourcing has become a new service paradigm in which a task requester could recruit a batch of participants with a mobile IoT device from our system for quick and accurate results. In a mobile industrial crowdsouring platform, a large amount of data is collected, extracted information and distributed to the requesters. More information about mobile crowdsensing:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsensing

The participant selection problem in mobile Crowdsensing has been proved to be a NP-hard problem. We presents a multi-goal participant selection approach to iteratively update the participant selection policy via multi-task deep reinforcement learning.
