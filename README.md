# Deep-Reinforcement-Learning
A Deep Reinforcement Learning Suite

## An Overview of The **DRL** Suite 

In recent years, we are constantly working on the implementation of various Deep Reinforcement Learning Methods, following the excellent research achievements from both industry and academic circles as shown in the diagram below.<br></br>

*We are applying ourself to developing an efficient, flexible and practical machine learning suite to share with Deep Learning researchers. Welcome to STAR, FORK or SHARE our code! More implementations of DRL Methods will be updated continuously!*
